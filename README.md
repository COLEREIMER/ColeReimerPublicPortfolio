Profile:
As a senior at Montana State University in Bozeman, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Analytics, I am eager to secure an internship that will provide me with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with all facets of the software development process as currently utilized in industry. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to projects, expanding my knowledge and skills, and learning from colleagues and mentors. After a successful internship, I hope to have a deeper understanding of the various aspects of software engineering, and thus be better prepared to enter the industry in a full-time capacity upon my graduation in December 2023.
